Included in this repository are samples of my code from various
assignments I have been given in a classroom setting.

1. C Samples

	- WIC Interpreter
		The WIC Interpreter is an interpreter written in
		C which interprets the pseudo-language 'WIC' into
		straight C. The WIC pseudo-language was designed
		for this exercise. This folder includes several
		test programs to run the interpreter on as well
		as a README which describes in more detail what
		the Interpreter can and cannot do.

2. Java Samples

	- Traveling Salesmen
		This program is an exercise in Java in which we
		read data from a file and used it to calculate the
		shortest route by which two salesmen can hit up
		every major city in the data file.

3. Prolog Samples

	- Factorial
		A program designed while getting my feet wet in my
		first experience with a declarative language.
		Calculates the factorial of an input number.

	- Fibonacci
		Another simple program written while learning Prolog.
		Calculates and displays the fibonacci sequence.

	- Merge
		Another program written while learning Prolog. This
		is an implementation of Merge Sort.

	- MyLen
		Another simple program written while learning Prolog.
		Calculates the length of a list.

	- Odd
		Another simple program written while learning Prolog.
		Determines whether an input number is odd.

4. Web Samples

4.1 CSS

	- Presidents Site
		This web site was my first attempt at using CSS. The
		aesthetics were dictated by my professor and I designed
		the site around his spec. The biography for George Washington
		is the only one we were required to include.

4.2 HTML

	- First Web Page
		This page is the first page I ever wrote in HTML. It is
		very simple with no CSS, but demonstrates that I have been
		using HTML 5 from the beginning.

4.3 JavaScript

	- Race Time and Pace Calculator
		This page allows a user to input a race time and a race distance
		and calculate the pace at which they were running. The user can
		also input any two of those and calculate the third. There is also
		a drop-down menu which allows the user to choose a unit.

	- Running Training Log
		This page allows a user to input a set of data and store it in a
		database that is stored in the user's local storage and loaded out
		whenever the user returns to the page.

4.4 JQuery

	- Tic Tac Toe
		Somewhat the culmination of my semester of Client-Side web program-
		ing, this page is a fully functional game of tic tac toe, complete
		with fancy animations.


Thanks for looking into my code samples. If I find more code to post I will be updating
this repository, so watch this space!
