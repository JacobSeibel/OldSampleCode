<h2>Bio</h2>

<pre style="font-family: Times New Roman;">    Hello.  I know what you're thinking.  Who is this man, and why do they call
him "Danger"?  The truth is, they don't call me that.  Because by the time they
get a chance, they're <del>dead</del> incapacitated.  You see, I may seem to be a mild-
mannered Computer Science student by day, but by night, I am an action hero.
I'm a world-class super spy who has gone up against James Bond and won.  So yeah.
I'm kind of dangerous, but you know.  Just don't end up in my orders and you'll be
juuust fine.  <del>Also, you'll probably be totally fine anyway because I'm usuall only
dreaming when I'm a super spy.</del></pre>

<h2>Web Programming Experience</h2>

<pre style="font-family:Times New Roman;">    Well, obviously I have hacked many websites in my career as a super spy.  But
that experience really counts, since I was breaking down websites rather than setting
them up.  I did have some experience working with web design during high school when
I ran the website for my local Baptist Association.  We used a web host called eZekiel.
The web host provided an interface that let me do most things by pointing and clicking,
but there were a few elements I would occasionally have to finetune by getting down and
dirty with the HTML.</pre>
